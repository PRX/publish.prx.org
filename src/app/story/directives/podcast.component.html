        Every podcast episode on iTunes should have a permanent, case-sensitive globally unique identifier (GUID).
        When an episode is added to a podcast's RSS feed, the episode is deemed "new" if no episode with that GUID exists
        yet in the feed. In certain rare cases, it can make sense to give an existing episode a new GUID.
        If you'd like to change the GUID for this episode, you may do so here.
